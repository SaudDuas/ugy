        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to
        break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
        separated by short breaks. It is designed to improve productivity and
        focus by allowing you to work in short, focused bursts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technique is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental
        agility. By working in short bursts and taking breaks, you can maintain
        focus and avoid burnout.
